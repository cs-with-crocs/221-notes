## Asymptotics

### Review
We use a positive function to describe the running time of an algorithm, which gives us a way of characterizing its value. (Faster is better)

```c++
int _idxFirst_ (vector<int> arr, int q) {
  for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
    if (arr[i] == q)
      return i;
  }
  return -1;
}
```
**Best case running time:** Constant

**Worst case running time:** Linear

**Average case running time:** distribution inputs must be known!! 

**Depends on: Array Size, Location of a Machine, Speed**

**What should we count?**
