## Lecture 1.2

* An algorithm is *correct* if it produces intended result for problem within specified construction

### Efficiency of Algorithms
* **Time** & **Space** are most common metrics
* Express **Time** as a positive function, non-decreasing (bigger the data size, longer the time)
* Form of the function depends on the structure of the algorithm
```javascript
T(n) // n: inputs are usually integers 
T(n) = 2n + 3 seconds // example of linear function, line increases with n
```
