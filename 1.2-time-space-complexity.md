## Lecture 1.2: Reasoning About Algorithms and Structures

An algorithm is *correct* if it produces intended result for problem within specified construction.

### Efficiency of Algorithms
* **Time** & **Space** are most common metrics
* Express **Time** as a positive function, non-decreasing (bigger the data size, longer the time)
* Form of the function depends on the structure of the algorithm
```javascript
T(n) // n: inputs are usually integers 
T(n) = 2n + 3 seconds // example of linear function, line increases with n
```

 * From table above, can see how much time is saved using an ```n``` instead of an ```2^n``` algorithm.

### Example 
```c++
int indexOfFirst(vector<int> arr, int q) { // vector<int> is a standard template library
  for (int i=0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
    if (arr[i] == q)
      return i;
  }
  return -1;
}
```
* Purpose: Searches for int within array, and returns the index
* Time Complexity: ```O(n)```
    * Depends on machine speed, size of array ```n```, and location of ```q``` in the list
    * Best case: at the very front, is consant
    * Worst case: Not in the list
* When should we count?
```c++
T(n) = An + B
T(n) = 2b + 1
```

### Quick Notes
- space (memory), time
- correctness of algorithm

An algorithm is correct if it produces the exact deterministic intended result for a problem within specified constraints on time and space (on all possible inputs to the algorithm)

- if it produces intended result in the most, if it is always close. Probably approximately correct algorithms (PAC)

Measuring the value of algorithms.
Suppose 2 algorithms that solve same problem, which is better?
- use different metrics: time and space most common
- Express _Time_ as a (positive) function
- Form of function depends on the structure of the algorithm
T(n), n \in Z+
T: \Z -> \R
n inputs are usually integers. 

Can't have negative linear graph, but can have horizontal line, if algorithm returns 1

Running Times
Large impact of runtime on algorithms
n -> nlogn -> n^2 -> n^3 -> 2^n

What does it do?
Returns index of first instance of q in arr if it exists, else returns -1.
How long does it take? Depends on size of array n, position of q in the list, machine speed
- best case at front: constant time
- worst case: not in list, having to traverse entire array) always use worst case analysis. 

What should we count? T(n) = _ n + _
Evaluating worst case on example code: T(n) = 2n + 1
2 since for loop, then if statement. 1 since return -1 line of code
